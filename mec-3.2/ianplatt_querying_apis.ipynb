The goat was eventually chosen as the team\\'s permanent mascot due to the fact that goats were common on early ships. The goats would eat garbage and any undesirable food and turn it into milk, which could also be made into butter. Of course the ships would also carry livestock as it provided a source of fresh meat for the sailors during their ventures. The first goat mascot at a Navy game was named El Cid however after the first official goat mascot appeared in the early 1900s the goat was given the name Bill which was the name of a pet goat kept by Commander Colby M.

Anonymous. Worked in cross stitch, in wool yarns on an open weave canvas ground. An old English &quot;M&quot; is in the center and the date Feb. 1878 appears at the top. Among the motifs, which are densely arranged, with no particular connection among them, are: figures dressed in Colonial garb; a puppet show stage labeled &quot;Guignol&quot;; pitchfork-holding devils; various animals (several different cats, two goats butting heads; monkeys; donkey; elephant; heraldic dragon; chicken; insects) children on a seesaw; a man on a bicycle; musical instruments; a stereotypical Indian figure with the motto above it &quot;Up to Snuff&quot; suggesting it was taken from a tobacco advertisement; and a small square with the stereotypical black &quot;dancing figures&quot; with the motto &quot;We\\'s Free.&quot; The random assortment of motifs suggests that the maker copied readily available images, perhaps from pattern books or magazines.

Among the motifs, which are densely arranged, with no particular connection among them, are: figures dressed in Colonial garb; a puppet show stage labeled \\\\\"Guignol\\\\\"; pitchfork-holding devils; various animals (several different cats, two goats butting heads; monkeys; donkey; elephant; heraldic dragon; chicken; insects) children on a seesaw; a man on a bicycle; musical instruments; a stereotypical Indian figure with the motto above it \\\\\"Up to Snuff\\\\\" suggesting it was taken from a tobacco advertisement; and a small square with the stereotypical black \\\\\"dancing figures\\\\\" with the motto \\\\\"We\\'s Free.\\\\\" The random assortment of motifs suggests that the maker copied readily available images, perhaps from pattern books or magazines.

Includes bibliographical references. As the title suggests, this thesis comprises several works of creative nonfiction. First, &quot;Zen and the Art of Conquest&quot; presents an incomplete narrative, in six chapters, that draws inspiration from Robert Pirsig\\'s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (1974) and other travelogues. In Chapter One, the author embarks on a road trip to Las Vegas that seems haunted by his past--that is, his Peace Corps service in Kyrgyzstan, where &quot;the killing started&quot; just a month ago. Chapter Two begins with a flashback from an earthquake that preceded the killing, but then moves back to the road, where the author has reached Prineville, Oregon, also a stop on Pirsig\\'s journey. Pushing farther south, in Chapter Three, through Indian country, the author recalls childhood memories of Cathlapotle, a Chinook village described in Lewis and Clark\\'s journals. Chapter Four profiles the author\\'s father and grandfather, who devoted themselves to unearthing a Mayan graveyard in Guatemala. The Maya\\'s ancestors migrated south from Asia and then Oregon, the author discovers, and this fact drives his thinking in Chapter Five. He\\'s determined to reach Las Vegas because he wants to put questions about what happened in Kyrgyzstan to a former Peace Corps volunteer living there with his Kyrgyz wife. Chapter Five concludes with the author\\'s arrival in Osh, the scene of the killing, and Chapter Six alternates between his approach to the Oregon-Nevada border and a village feast where Kyrgyz men butcher livestock and grill him about Amerikadan. Three essays constitute the second half of this thesis. &quot;What Happened Yesterday in Baghdad&quot; recounts the author\\'s conversations with a group of Iraqi students visiting Colorado. Their wartime memories resonate with his life as a public radio producer between 2004 and 2008--a time when he assembled reports for correspondents in Baghdad and helped &quot;voice&quot; the words of the conflict\\'s victims. &quot;Exposure Time&quot; reflects on the author\\'s preoccupation with dying in a cycling accident, which in turn offers an entry into recollections of violence in Cartagena, Colombia, and Osh, Kyrgyzstan. The final essay, &quot;I\\'d Like to Talk About the Bigger Stuff,&quot; explores the author\\'s separation from a woman who observes, after his Peace Corps service, that he no longer has compassion for animals. This observation invites a meditation on American relationships with dogs, cats, and wildlife; the roles of dogs, goats, and horses in Kyrgyzstan; and the legacy of the Soviet Union in Central Asia.

In 1904, he left St. Louis and permanently moved to western North Carolina. Living and working in a cabin on Hazel Creek in Swain County, Kephart began to document life in the Great Smoky Mountains. He created 27 journals in which he made copious notes on a variety of topics. Journal 26 (previously known as Journal XVII) includes information on firearms.

WHAT SHOOTING DOES FOR THE SHOOTER. All forms of sport have an effect on those \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ho play them and the effect on the player is often n dcterminin factor in the value of the sport. In many way:; shooting with a shot\\xc2\\xadgun, rifle or pistol either at a target or hunting in the lield is an especially \\\\\\\\\\'alttahle sport. It gives recreation and in addition develops to a high degree the mental faculty of concen\\xc2\\xadtration, and in fact a shooter\\'s suc\\xc2\\xadcess depends to a very large extent upon his ability to concentrate and co-ordinate the effort of every nerve and muscle 1to get the desired result. Slip- hod and careless people never become e~pcrts either os hunters or target shooters for they will not de\\xc2\\xadvote the necessary energy and thought to their problems. Consequently the man who makes a ucces of shooting is necessarily the one who can keep his mind working along the proper c-hannels. Boys and young men a.re often lacking alonrr th,\\xe2\\x80\\xa2s&quot; lines and that is o11e of thr reasons why shooting should he ,\\xc2\\xb7nconragccl especially in school and eo! leges. \\\\\\\\nother feature of shooting, and one which is rather important is th train\\xc2\\xading of the ~hooter\\' , t\\'ye. m. n wf10 ha. done a great deal of hooting, especially hunting, develop keen powers of obs rvation and u ually set\\'. things m re quickly and accurately than the average man who has never used his eye citht\\xe2\\x80\\xa2r to locate wary game or to make close visual adju t \\xc2\\xadments such as are nece. ary in prop\\xc2\\xadt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 rly lining up the ights of a firearm .

H: STEVE~ S Mr. Stevens i now and was last year the manager of the trapshooting school in Atlantic City, N. J. lie is a student of trapshooting and on idered one of the most efficient instructors in the United States. Therefore his views on this subject are worth while. JUST as long as the earth revolves there will be people insisting that expert marks\\xc2\\xadmen are born-not made. My experiences as manager of the Trapshooting School on the Million Dollar Pier, Atlantic City, N. ]., cause me to take the opposite view-that marksmen are made not born. I had a great opportunity to study people last year at the trapshooting school and I got a lot of quiet amusement out of watching people who had never fired a gun, take to the sport like a duck to water. There was more fun still in coaching experienced shooters out of the &quot;SO-SO&quot; class. Of course, in the case of a raw beginner there may be need for but very little instruc\\xc2\\xadtion, or he may require a great deal; but at the worst it is simple, because he has formed no habits. llaving by a few simple t~sts de\\xc2\\xadtermined the eyesight presents no dtfficulty, and selected a gun with a stork o \\xc2\\xa3 a shape to fit reasonably well, then a little instruction in handling the gun usually starts him break\\xc2\\xading targets. The rest is a matter of. refine\\xc2\\xadment in gun fitting, coaching and practtce. Naturally, some beginners make progress faster than others. But it is not that one is endowed by nature with betler shooting ability than the other, but that he simply learns quicker and better. The most common of all faults and which most handicaps almost every beginner and every dub shooter, is a bad shooting position. This can be corrected, in most cases, very easily by coaching. Possession of a gun which does not fit the shooter cannot be correctly called a fault; rather, it is a misfortune. The beginner. in wing-shooting knows nothing about selectmg a gun to fit him. And I usually find that the man who comes along and confesses to me that he had some experience but is a poor shot has been handicapping himself with a misfit gun. Generally he doesn\\'t even know the dimensions of his gunstock. Reverting to the subject of position, the be\\xc2\\xadginner and very often the dub shooter, when taking up a gun for the first time. at the sc??ol, would assume a decidedly stramed pos1hon, holding the gun awkwardly and balancing at the waist with hips thrust forward and shoul\\xc2\\xad&lt; lers back. :t-laturally, each had to he taught to stand firmlv on both feet, lean slightly for\\xc2\\xadward and swii1g freely from the hips. For another thing, sometimes the beginner showed an apparently unbreakable destre to raise the check from the gun stork when the target appeared in Hight, and, of course, con\\xc2\\xadtinued to miss until he learned better. Other grave faults were inclination to hold too long on the target before ftring, and flinching. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'ithout coaching the tyro \\\\\\\\yon!~! not easily outgrow these faults, but wtth tt rapid progress was always made. I have fonnd it interesting and useful to study the beginners from the human-nature standpoint. For instance, supposing a new man comes along: it may be a good thing to just let him find his way around, so to speak, and not give him too much attention. TT e gets a gun. and you sec at once if )1e is familiar with it. J f not, you will see hun watching the other shooters. This he will do either frankly and with manifest iutercst, or out of the corner of his eye. If the former. you know you can go right ahead and trll him and he will learn quickly; if the latter, you\\' must take your time, only suggest things, ask diplomatic questions and let him have the pleasure of finding it all out for himself. By using a t rygun, the construction and use of which has been descrilwd in previous arti des. we take the exact Itt of each shoott\\xe2\\x80\\xa2r, thus insuring a proper gun is provided for use during instruction and also enabling him or her to ohtain r rom any gun maker precisely the fit in a gunstock that it is necessary to have to shoot well. l1ut among all of the many heginners I haven\\'t found a single born crack shot nor one who cnuld not learn . \\'I he prevalent, arly idea that pi tol hot~ wer born and not mad per-hap. had it. rio\\xc2\\xb7in in r markabl tri~k- and !\\'nap- hooting, a. typifi d by th\\' work of cv ral mark. m n who either pr c d d or w re cont \\'mporary &quot;ith the Benn tt. and Paine.

SOME men ju&gt;t naturally cannot keep from hitting game. They are born ~ho t5. Maybe it ih the gun used, im;tead of the man, but at any rate we have all met the fellow who kills game with uncanny regularity. nder ordinary circum\\xc2\\xad\\' tances, seeing is believing, but when it come5 to fishing and ~ hooting yarns, we long ago adopted the rule to believe nothing that we heard and only half that we 5aw. The illustration on this page shows you what we have 5een and we are going to tell you the tale as told to us. You can give the credit to either gun or gunner, as you see fit. On December 15, 1918, George S. Scofield, a lawyer with offices at Room 2289 Woolworth Building, New York City, and Capt. George Ackerly, a professional guide of Patchogue, Long Island, were shooting ducks from a double battery on Great South Bay. In this form of shooting the gunners lie side by side in the coffin-like compartment of the battery which is anchored off shore. As the duck5 come into the decoys which surround the battery, the gunners sit up and open t1re. A flock of broadbills decoyed. Both gunners rai,rd and fired one barrel. For the second shot Mr. Scofield was following a bird fairly well up in the air, while Captain Ackerly had picked out a bird closer to the water. Just a5 1\\\\\\\\[r. Scofield was about to pull the trigger, his bird crumpled and fell and he felt a jar as though his gun had been dis\\xc2\\xadrharged. However, he knew he had not shot and on opening his gun, he found the \\xc2\\xb7shell had not been fired. 1\\\\\\\\Ir. Scofield explains the incident in this way, and he has the gun to prove it. Just as he was about to fire, Captain Ackerly, swinging ahead of his bird, pulled the trigger. The charge from the Captain\\'s gun hit the barrels of Mr. Scofield\\'s gun about SL&quot;&lt; inches from the muzzle, entered the left tube and followed on out the barrel, killing the duck that Mr. Scofield was aiming at. This barrel was almo5t entirely clo&gt;ed and had Mr. Scofield pulled the trigger, the gun would undoubtedly have blown up and possibly killed both gunners. There you have ill Some men just naturally cannot help killing ducks, or maybe they train their !(Uns so no effort on their part is necessary. 13~ rl.~!J-~~&quot;:&quot; ~ oli,\\'~ \\':J.~, 16fl \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 15.

In some later tests, when the same barrel was reduced a further five inches in length, a loss of _Q per cent in energy was recorded, which is probably explained by the fact that the burning gases give up the whole of their force quite early in the passage of the bullet through the barrel, so that the greater part of the impulse is gained by about the mid\\xc2\\xadpoint of the barrel; while for the last five inches in the case of the full length barrel the enr1gy imparted to the bullet does not greatly exceed the friction of the same again t the bore. _ VELOCITY OF .303 LEE-F.NFTELD WfTII THREE DLFFERENT LENGTHS OF 13AlU~t::L .

Vertical Firing. 737J77,7,y. 20:ct. ~, w 1 JffZ\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 1 : _,,,, 62 Vertical Firing Editor Outdoor Life.-After reading Mr. Thomas\\' article on &quot;Star Hunting&quot; In the September issue it occurred to me that perhaps the results of some experiments on this line and the computations on altitude, time of flight, etc., might be of Interest. In the first place he has evidently been misinformed as to the range of the Spring\\xc2\\xadfield rifle, as he gives it as between seven and eight surface miles. Springfield, but can submit some on this work with the English service arm. The English Mark VII bullet weighs 174 grains and the velocity is 2,440 t. s., so there is after all not so very much difference in the ballistics of the two cartridges at long range. Mr. Tippins and other well-known Eng\\xc2\\xadlish rinemen have succeeded in timing the flight of vertically fired bullets. The Ordnance Department gives the ex\\xc2\\xadtreme range of the Springfield as 6,4Gfi yards, or a trifle over three miles. In this shooting the firing Is done at an angle or 45 degrees. The highest point of the tra\\xc2\\xadjectory is 6,844 feet and this height is reached at a distance of 3,432 yards !rom the firing point. The angle of descent Is about 68 degrees and the bullet strikes the ground with a remaining velocity computed at 203 ft. sees. Time of flight computed at 31 seconds. One or their interesting observations is that it strikes the ground with its point in the same direction as it leaves the gun. If fired straight up it comes down base first. The table or computations on vertical firing with English service ritle is as fol\\xc2\\xadlows : Height Velocity. Ascended. Time of Ascent. (Feet per second) (Feet) (Seconds) 2,440 0 2,400 59 2,000 680 1,500 1,569 1,000 3,238 500 7,139 0 9,816 0.00 0.02 0.31 0.84 2.22 7.68 19.66 Like many other readers of Outdoor Life, I began my shooting with sllng\\xc2\\xb7shot, cross\\xc2\\xadbow and bow and arrow. From what I could see of the flight of the projectiles I used I always supposed they carried far\\xc2\\xadther when fired at an angle than when shot straight up. So sure did I feel of this that I told a friend that in my opinion the Springfield would only shoot about two miles straight up. The bullet takes 31 seconds to reach the ground in its return and strikes the ground with a velocity of 473 feet per second. I have no data on vertical firing with the To settle a dispute could you please tell me whether a bullet fir d straight up from a Springfield rifle will reach the ground at the same velocity as It left the rifle? Will the bull t fall base or point first and what will be tho energy when It hits the ground? Also, how high will the bullet go?- I-I. N. Anderson, Portland, Ore. Answcr.-The bullet would strilte the ground with a small fraction of the velocity It possessed when It left the muzzle for the reasons given In the reply to Mr. Malone In this Issu e. If you have disturbed Its flight It would strike base first, but they occasion\\xc2\\xadally tip over and fall point first, In which case the velocity at strildng Is decidedly higher than In case where they come down base first. We have no data as to how high this particular bullet would go. The dis\\xc2\\xadcussion you have In mind will be found In the January, 1915, Issue of Outdoor Life, pages 88 to 90.-Edltor. () -1.4 .. , a-,., I \\'f 17. If a rifle were shot vertically and after the bullet came back to earth would the speed per second be the same as when It left the rifle, or less. If a round ball weighing a pound, and an ordinary buckshot, were dropped from an aeroplane a mile In the air, would they reach the earth at the same time? Both of these questions to be practical, tak\\xc2\\xadIng Into consideration air resistance, etc.; not as to textbooks on physlcs.-Carl Mahone, Cleveland, Ohio. Answer.-The bullet on striking the earth would have much less velocity than when It started upward for the reason that many times as much of thE!- energy of the bullet Is absorbed in overcoming air resistance as In overcoming the attraction of gravitation. The energy thus lost Is lost forever. On the return trip there Is likewise a great deal of energy absorbed by the resistance of the at\\xc2\\xadmosphere, and this, likewise, Is lost. The energy the bullet possesses when It strikes the earth Is that absorbed on the upward trip in overcoming the attraction of gravita\\xc2\\xadtion. Touching the dropping of the ball and the buckshot this would depend altogether on what the ball were made of. If it were lead the larger ball would reach the earth more quickly than the buckshot, as It would over\\xc2\\xadcome the air resistance better. If it were o! lighter material It would depend upon Its specific gravlty.-Edltor. California. E. L. STEJVENSON. Some weeks ago I replied In your valuable magazine to one &quot;Bill&quot; as to bow high a rifle will shoot. I also spoke of a question in mental \\xc2\\xb7arith\\xc2\\xadmetic as to how a, person could in\\xc2\\xadcrease his weight while standing on the scales by lifting up as much as possi\\xc2\\xadble, or by reaching up and pushing up with all his force on the beam of the scales. .I asked Mr. Chauncy Thomas why it was so that my weight would increase according to the amount of pressure exerted, to which Mr. Thomas replied: &quot;Nonsense,&quot; &quot;Impossible.&quot; That gentleman knows very little of Euclid, for it certainly increases your weight, according to the amount of pressure you exert over your own weight. Mr. T. has not tried it, hence he does not speak with the knowledge of &quot;proof.&quot;- E. M. Herron, Cleve\\xc2\\xadland, 0. Answer.-Mr. Thomas was certainly most disrespectful. A man would show \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 the same increase in weight under the circumstances mentioned as a spring would thru being placed in tension. Un\\xc2\\xadfortunately very few scales are suffi\\xc2\\xadciently sensitive to measure this.\\xc2\\xadEditor. 72.

D. Answer.-In answ ring your question we cnn glvt&gt; only our p rsonal Impres\\xc2\\xadsions. When nny rltle Is !Ired It is thrown Into a state of vibration thru Its entire length, th vibrations beginning with the jar of th hammer !nlllng, be\\xc2\\xadIng Increased by th explosion of the primer and still mor so by the ignition ot the charge, and this regardless of the type of weapon fired. Obviously ljeavy barr~?ls vibrate less than light, and heavy guns less than light. The vlbt\\'a\\xc2\\xb7 tlon originates In the barr 1 and Is transmitted thruout the gun. The best shooting Is obtained when the entire iJ\\xc2\\xadfle vibrates as unltormly ns posstble. For this reason the more tightly the barrel Is screwed Into the action the more uniformly will the entire rille vi\\xc2\\xadbrate, but there Is always Interruption In the vlbrat~on at th\\'ls point. The utility or the one-piece stoclt rs In that It passes this point ana tends to distribute the vi\\xc2\\xadbration uniformly over the entire gun, hence a rifle with a one-piece stoclt shoots more accurately than ~ rltl.,; with n two-plec stock. While on with a two-plec and the barrel screvt,ed tight \\xc2\\xadly Into the action shoots more accurate\\xc2\\xadly than one with n two-piece stoclt, the barrel of which Is loose In th ac\\xc2\\xadtion. The joint wh re the barrel joins the receiver Is the point wher\\xc2\\xb7c the mis\\xc2\\xadchief Is &lt;lon . vVo nrc nwnro that this may cause many of our renders to !m\\xc2\\xadmedlnt&lt;\\' ly declar they have s&lt;\\xe2\\x80\\xa2en thl\\' best results from guns wlth two- piece storks, ven Stevens target rilles, the barrels of which arc scr w d loosely 1 nto the ncllon and fastened wllh a set scr w. There Is no question but some of the latter type of rifles have given most extreme accuracy, This we co n\\xc2\\xadsider due to the fact that they w ere shot I unci P target conclltlons where the meth\\xc2\\xadOd of holding was absolutely uniform, and consequently the vibration, wh ll ~ excessive, was uniform, and thus gave uniform results. However, one. of these extremely fine target rifles tal!:en apart o~Pond put together again might not shoot :\\xc2\\xb7\\'to the same zero as when it was taken apart.-Edltor. ) 100.

Nature\\'s Healing Process in Animals Editor Outdoor Life:-If you wish to see a remarkable mending of a shattered jaw\\xc2\\xadbone I will send you the bear\\'s skull that I mentioned in a former letter. This bear had been shot by a hunter a year or so (possibly longer) previous to my killing him, but thru the healing process of nature had been able to eat and masticate his food and finish Ufe in the full vigor of healthy bearhood. He must, of course, have suf\\xc2\\xadfered much in the early days of the injury and until the fragments of bone had healed sufficiently to hold the jaw in a steady position while eating. The bone is not completely mended and shows a process that is wonderful. It also shows the lack of penetration in light, high\\xc2\\xadpower bullets when they get up against any-thing that Is hard and tough, and yet loose enough to give. The mark of the bullet on nose of slmll Is healed, but It may be located by the unhealed, rough break In the bone on under side of entrance wound. (Fig. 2). The lower jaw was entirely cut In two (Figs. 3 and 4), as is shown by healing process, and much gristle, or partly formed bone, came away with the flesh when the skull was boiled, to clean it. Until I boiled the skull I did not discover the character of the wound, or would have used more care. The .22 bullet with which I finished the bear was a Remington hollow point, and ap\\xc2\\xadpears to have expanded some In the skin before striking the bones- this bullet is in the base of the skull. I did not discover it A BEAR\\'S BROKEN JAW THAT HEALED. Fig. 1-Where bullet entered thru right nostril. Fig. 2- Where It broke thru upper jaw. tearing out most of the teeth of that member. Fig. 3-Where It tore Into lower jaw, breaking the bone in two places, at Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. Figs. 4 and 6-New bone formed over the old extending under jaw for 4 in., encircling the breaks at 3 and 4 and holding them firmly. until after the skull was cleaned, and it lays exactly as it lodged after passing thru the bear\\'s brain-fired out of a .22 Reming\\xc2\\xb7 ton repeater. You might be curious to know how I came to have the .22 with me: I was horse\\xc2\\xadback, and had both .22 and .30\\xc2\\xb730 on my saddle, and made a long shot with the .30 and broke the bear\\'s back-finishing him with the .22 for the sake of the skull. You will be surprised to learn that with only one side of his face in working order the bear was fat, and that in .August, also his skin (fur) was good-$10 worth. In this letter I enclose the .25 bullet that smashed the bear\\'s jaw. It was badly used up before it lodged, as you can see, but the smooth case proves it a .25-35. Colorado. .A. C. ROWELL. Note-There are many sportsmen who be\\xc2\\xadlieve that some animals may not feel pain as keenly as others. How true this is can only be coniectured, but we had an experi\\xc2\\xadence in Wyoming once with a grizzly that made us wonder some about it. We shot the bear first thru the hind foot while he was traveling broadside to us, the bullet breaking two or three of the bones just above the toes and emerging at the side of the foot. Thru this exit the blood flowed just enough to show a little red spot in the snow about the size of a half dollar at the side of his foot print. The print of the foot was very clearly seen In the fresh snow and showed that the bear had not spared that foot at all, but apparently had put as much weight on It as on the other feet. We have often wondered If the sense of pain might not have been somewhat deadened in this instance by the excitement of the chase, for we were hot on his trail for many miles, and he was also greatly aggravated by the pursuing dogs.-Edltor. The Killing Power of Bullets Lieut. Wm. H. Swett. I would like to know if anyone other than myself ever decided that the phenomenon of the tremendous rending power of the mod- I had occasion to conduct several months or experlnwnts two years ago for several of my clients to determine the exact reason for such rending, smashing and tearing power ns the military arm loaded with the Spitzer projectile Is known to have; which as every wcll\\xc2\\xb7read military and experimental rifleman knows to be directly in reverse ot the theory upon which the hard-point Spitzer was fimt brought out. To properly explain the results of these experiments would require a lot or space and a great number or diagrams. Missiles moving at the rate of 2,200 ft.\\xc2\\xb7 sec., upon impact, due to the heat gener\\xc2\\xadated, causes the splitting apart or dissocia\\xc2\\xadlion of the hydrogen and carbon and the hydrogen and oxygen contained in flesh; fats being composed of hydrogen and car\\xc2\\xadbon and water hydrogen and oxygen, either being or sufficient density to offer enough resistance to the projectile to produce the required amount of heat. As all animal tissue is composed largely of the above substances, we have the most favorable condition to produce this phe\\xc2\\xadnomenon. The peculiar wedge-shape, point\\xc2\\xaded Spitzer projectile, exposing a greater an\\xc2\\xadgle surface upon Impact to absorb the shock than does the round-nose or the flat-pointed missile, generates the greater volume ot Cuts with stream lines showing disturbed area and energy absorbed. No. 1, convex spitzer ; No. 2, concave spitzer; No. 3, round nose; No. 4, flat nose. heat and gas, aside from producing a greater volume of acute angle liquid stream lines. Hence the greater wound and increased killing power produced over those of the hard-point projectiles of other shapes, and is also responsible for the great number of newspaper articles we see about the war\\xc2\\xadring armies in Europe using &quot;dum-dum&quot; pro\\xc2\\xadjectiles. The entire trouble is that the killed and wounded soldiers are within the explosive zone, as their slashing wounds are nothing more than the results oi the explosive power of the gases generated, together with the back splash of the liquids contained in the ern high-power, as, for example, the Newton .266 high-power, is due to some other than the commonly accepted ideas or deductions. cell tissue; as for example, note the back splash from the front of a boat in rapid motion. The two causes are both brought into action more thoroughly by the wedge ot\\xc2\\xb7 Spitzer projectile than any of the others with hard points, due to its special design. \\\\\\\\V. IT.

Reverse the shape from a convex, from point to shoulder, to a concave, and w tremE&quot;n\\xc2\\xb7 dously narrow the effect in discussion. A formula can E&quot;asily be found fot\\xc2\\xb7 this action. I will herewith give a Few simple tests to demonstrate the abov statements. Taite several sheets of paper, soak to Raturatlon one-half tho numb!\\'r In animal rat and of the others but one in water, tho extra sheet ]{eep dry. Suspend these sheets in a frame, one behind tho other, about two and one-half or three inches apart; then take any of the arms uslug ammunition giv\\xc2\\xb7 ing known velocities from 2,000 ft.-sec. and up to 3,000 ft.-soc. that may be available, and fire through tho suspended sheets of paper and note results. The greasy and wet sheets will show clean-cut holes of about one inch in diam\\xc2\\xb7 eter when the .30 Governm nt \\'06 arm and ammunition is used up to about 100 yards (150-grain projectile) and a very marked decrease in diameter of hole at each twenty \\xc2\\xb7 five yards\\' gain in distance until the hole is normal. The other arms will speak for themselves in this test. I once had an OJ:)portunity in an interest\\xc2\\xading way to put into practice an idea gained from these experiments and at the same time check the results in actual practice. While deer-hunting with a .30 Government rifle, I saw a large deer take to the waters of the stream along which I was hunting. The animal swam very low in the water, with only the head exposed, and was cross\\xc2\\xading the stream in a quartering position from where I stood. I aimed just forward of the hips so as to strike the water just over the small of the back. The shock completf\\'ly paralyzed the animal. Upon examination there was a strip 3% inches wide by 10\\xc2\\xa5.! inches long from which the hair and &quot;grain&quot; or the epidermis was completely removed. There was absolutely no other sign of wound. Photographic plates made of sheets of wet and greasy paper at mo!llent of im\\xc2\\xadpact of projectile show gas and vapor rings very clearly. Unfortunately I have none of the photos on hand at present, and as they all went to France, I do not think I can se\\xc2\\xb7 cure any of them for publication. 102. 110. INT~ IOR BALLISTICS. 110 11~.

These special machine-gun cartridges are employed by German airmen Special Machine-Gun Bullets for Aerial Combat THE r cent announcrement of the War Department to the efTect that th ordnance bureau has dev loped bullets of three distinct types for use of airplane fighters, lends particula.r interest to the accompanying drawing of the special bullets employed by enemy airmen. With the introduction of the armored or partly armored airplane, it has b come necessary to introduce t.he armor\\xc2\\xadpiercing bullet. In the case of the German bullet for this purpose, it will be noted that the projectile consists of a German silver jacket to take the rifling of the gun barrel, with a core of steel. Obviously, such a bullet has great piercing powers. and it is reported that the German airmen make particular efforts to disable the engine of their opponent with this type of missile. The gasoline tank being the most vulnerable member of the airplane, especially if it can be set aflame, special incendiary bullets have been developed for the aerial fighters. The German incendiary or tracing bullet is hollow, and contains an incendiary matter of a phosphor base. It leaves in its wake a luminous and smoky train, destined to ignite balloons and gasoline tanks and to permit the gunner to rectify his fire. Even in total darkness, the gunner can follow the trajectory of the incendiary or tracer bullet by means of the bright spark, while in daylight he observes the smoky wake. Explosive bullets of the type shown are intended for all around purposes. Indeed, they are very much in the nature of a small shell, containing a small plunger forming a percussion firing pin over a detonating primer. It is said that this type of bullet is carried in belts and drums in the proportion of about ten to fifteen per one hundred, in German fighting planes.

Modern firearms are manufactured by machinery on a quantity basis and in the production of a new model the following steps must be gone through: \\\\\\\\~:uming that the inventor has finished a complete working model, thr first step towards putting th gun on the market is to make complete de\\xc2\\xadtailed drawings of every part of th gun. This takes considerable time as the dimensions of the various parts must be checked against each other, so that the allowable limits in the :&gt;ize and shape of the parts will always produce a perfect working mechan\\xc2\\xadism. I Aft r the drawings of the parts arc completed, proce s engineers tak each individual part and decide on just how it is to be mad from the raw material to the fini h d part, and then also decid on th\\' kinds of ma\\xc2\\xadchines to be used. After that the plans go to tool d sign r who make drawings of the fixtures and jigs nec\\xc2\\xadessary to hold the work for ca h op\\xc2\\xaderation and th cutters which cut away the steel or wood to hapc the parts. These drawing arc sent to the tool room where the fixtures and other tools are made, and after that another gang of skilkd m chanics set up the machines and get them work\\xc2\\xading properly. These machines are then turned over to the machine hands who arc to operate them, and the manufacture of parts is begun. At every step of the work, expen\\xc2\\xadsive, specially made gauges must be used to see that the parts are exactly the right size and hape. The secret of the a. toni~hingly high quality and low CO&gt;t of Ameril\\xc2\\xb7an made fire. rm lie in th pr tluction of many arm\\xc2\\xb7, all exactly ali \\xc2\\xb7e. \\'fher i a time interval of many. month. between the decision to man\\xc2\\xadufacture new firearm and the ap\\xc2\\xadpearance of the first model on the market and al o if production is once stoppc\\xe2\\x80\\xa2l on any model, even when everything- is ready to go ah ad, then~ will b-e everal months time between the forging of the rough tock to the final in pection of the finished arm, bee. u e each part must go through many operations in consecutive order. A part such as the receiver of a n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xc2\\xadpcating rifle or shotgun oft n requirl s as many as two or thr e hundred ~ eparatc distin t operations. mall parts such as pin and screws can of course be finished in quick time, but the complete gun must await the production of the part wh1ch requires longest to make. 192.

The simplest method i to make a cast of the chamber and send it to one o f the big ammunition com\\xc2\\xadpanics. Parafine wax can be used if y ou are cardill to get the ha rrl\\'l fair ly warm before pouring in the wax, but a better composition is a mixture of Sulphur and Graphite. Put a littk pi ece of waste or clot h. just in front of the chamber and pour the wax or SulQhttr mixture in the breech with the \\xc2\\xb7barrel poi nting towards the ground. After it has cooled off and s t. push it out careful ly by means of a cleaning rod inserted in the muzzle. New Rustless Metal Plant \\xc2\\xb7 Will Be Located in City Discoverey of Alloy By C. J . Rath; Can Be Forged Cold and Cost No More Than Iron Products. Perhaps the e~y long search nr lndu11try tor a metal which 111 lmper\\xc2\\xb7 vlous to rust and corrosion, which ce.., be twi11ted cold Into an auger or har.l\\xc2\\xb7 ened In the mukin~r 110 It m9,y be 11harpened like a razor, has ended wltn the discovery or an alloy by c. J. Rath. He cnlls It &quot;Everbrlte.&quot; Hath formerly Uved In \\'Varren, OhJo, where he 1pent many yean I working In an Iron foundry. Since boyhood, he ha. worked on the for\\xc2\\xb7 mula for a flux, or combination of chemical\\xe2\\x80\\xa2, which, 1\\'then burned with , certain metale will produce an alloy to etand up to all requirement!!. The alloy 111 made of lead, zinc, COli\\xc2\\xadper, nickel and man~raneee. The In\\xc2\\xadgredients are rlo eecret, he ald. The secret 11 the flux burned With them In a furnace which cau11e11 them to join together to make the new metal. This flux, Rath lllld, can be changed so the metal will be either bard or 11oft In any decree, It !11 tempered ln the alloying. A corporation, with $200,000 capital stock, ha.e been organized in Okh.\\xc2\\xadhoma City to mal(e this metal. A charter was applied for lut week. The temporary board ot directors Is composed of George G. Sohlberg, A. M. DeBolt, Charlel! Edward John\\xc2\\xadson, R. 0. Brewer, C. H. Russell. C. J. Rath and A. E. Kull. Rath, according to Kull, came to Oklahoma City with his proposition two months ago on request of the In\\xc2\\xb7 dustrlal development committee of the Chamber or Commerce, a committee or which Kull Js chairman. He had made one previous visit here and at that time told of his alloy to seveTal friends. He thim r-.turned to War\\xc2\\xadren, expecting to market his formula In the east, when bo was InVited to return. Under the direction of the com\\xc2\\xadmittee, samples of the alloy have been put under severe tests to dis\\xc2\\xadcover whether It would stand up to all claimed for lt. It hal! been submitted to the acid test and proved it wm not corrode, Kull said. Dr. Edwin D. Debarre, head or the departmellt of chemistry at the Unl\\xc2\\xadverstty f Oklahoma, hae made eev\\xc2\\xb7 eral ttllltll on It, according to Kull. He reporte4 It \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 restated the rust test and testa ma4e with all acids from tboM of the kltehen, 1uch all lemon Juice, to .\\xe2\\x80\\xa2troncer on\\xe2\\x80\\xa2. Doctor De- C. J. Rath. barre gave .It a tensile strength of 92,316 pound\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 to the square Inch, while the tensile strength of boiler eteel Is but about 66,000 pounda to the square Inch. It bas been tested In connection with fee and ammonia manufacturing mach!Mry and has been found to wltbetand tests which eteel or plate1 Iron would suffer under. Plain cast\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 lngs made from the alloy have been hammered and twisted without break\\xc2\\xadIng. When the same tests were worked upon common Iron castings, they broke into dozens of pieces, Kull said. Its principal value, according to Kull, Ill\\'s In the fact it can be made to practically replace nickel plated brass castings and will cost less to produce. It need not be plated and wlU last Indefinitely. Casting!! manufactured from &quot;Ever\\xc2\\xadbrlte&quot; have furthermore proved they will stand high speed machining, he said. The cost of manufacturing the metal ~\\xc2\\xb7111 be about the same a11 Iron products In many cases, In a11 much as less time will be required for ma\\xc2\\xadchining. PracUcnlly no time 111 re\\xc2\\xadquired for polishing after the lathe work as the alloy comes out fn a per\\xc2\\xadfectly emooth state, he declared. The company which will manufae\\xc2\\xb7 ture the alloy in Oklahorri&amp; City wilt not spend any of Its money for pro\\xc2\\xadmotion purpose!!, Kull said. It wi!l make no campaign for the B8le of stock and Is payln!r nothlnc more tban etock fer the use of the formula.

AN IMPROVED AUTOMATIC RIFLE. THE demonstrations with the Laird Menteyne Dcgaille rifle during the Bisley week seem to have been highly satisfactory, and to have given mans who witnessed them an impression that the reliable at~comatic rifle is not so far off perfection as was generally supposed. The Degaille rifle is a full automatic repeater, which, when charged, can be completely emptied without removing the rifle from the shoulder, the trigger being pressed to fire each round as the man behind the gun is able to correct his aim after each explosion. The recoiling block, which replaces the bolt of ordinary rifles, opens and remains open after each shot, to secure greater rapidity of fire. 1\\\\\\\\ notable feature of the Laird Menteyne Dcgaille rifle is that the same clips are used for carrying the ammunition as are in use with our short service rifle; they are automatically ejected as soon as all the cartridges are in the maga\\xc2\\xadzine, the capacity of which is from five to ten rounds. The weight of the rifle is approximately the same as our service arm, has the usual safety attachments, and seems to be well balanced. During the experi\\xc2\\xadments it was firing special cartridges which we understand were made at the King\\'s Xorton Works under specifications that fulfil all the service requirements. The muzzle velocity is stated to be 2,925 feet, with a trajectory of 4 feet 10 inches at the 800-yard target. This seems to be an advance on our present arming, and the progress of this auto\\xc2\\xadmatic gun will be closely followed. When the ammunition supply prob\\xc2\\xadlem has been s&quot;olved it will probably come in with a rush.-United S crvicc Ga::ctte. WHAT CONSTITUTES A GOOD RIFLE ACTION? There are a number of different type,; of repeating and autoloading a tions used on r,fh: of various cali\\xc2\\xadber , from the little .22 to the power\\xc2\\xadful big game rifles. To give good result any action must be capable of handling the car\\xc2\\xadtridge from the tim it i. placed in the magazine until it is ejected after firing, with ab olute certainty. To do this, every part must be sufficiently strong to stand any train which it can be called upon to bear, and the mechanical con !ruction must be such that the cartridge is properly held in its travel from the magazine to the rhamber, and extracted with a lever\\xc2\\xadage which will insure its removal from the chamber and ejection from the arm. It is, of course, de irable to have any repeatin action as imp! as possible but it is more important to have good, solid, husky parts. There have always been, and prob\\xc2\\xadably alway wilt be, a great many ar\\xc2\\xadguments as to which type of action gives the b t results. Such an argu\\xc2\\xadment will never be settled, however, h cause th personal likes and dis\\xc2\\xadlikes of the shooter enter into the problem to a very con iderable ex\\xc2\\xadtent. One may pr f r an autoloading rifle, another one may like a sliding action forearm type, and a third may insist upon a bolt action, and all three types will give the finest kind of service if they are properly de\\xc2\\xadsigned and carefully made. The choice is therefore up to the shooter. Some hunters claim that the hand operated typ s of actions are more reliable than the autoloading types. This is not true, as autoloading rifles when gi\\xc2\\xb7ven decent treatment will give just as good serviceJ as a!l\\\\\\\\Y other kind, and you cannot neglect any kind of firearm without paying the penalty of reduced accuracy and perhaps a jammed action at a critical moment. Bolt action rifles are considered by many to be somewhat more reliable than oth r type in that they will stand more abu e without actually lying down on the job. But, on the other hand, a bolt action rifle i slower in the hands of a man who ha little opportunity to practic , and in this connection ther is one point which i not often brought up in the discussion of reliability, and that is, that an autoloading action operat s without assistance from the hoot r, which means that it will function ex\\xc2\\xadactly a well in the hands of a nerv\\xc2\\xadous, excitable man, as it will with anyone else, and there i no doubt but that a good many shots at game have b en lost thru failure in a hand op r\\xc2\\xadated action to repeat, where the fault was not with the action but with the hunter who became so excited that he failed to work the lever, or pull the slide or bolt handle to the full extent of its motion. The ensible hunter never goe on an important trip without first sight\\xc2\\xading his rifle carefully to ee that the sights line up to suit his own eyes, and he should al o thoroughly famil\\xc2\\xadiarize himself with the action so that its proper operation becomes a matter of instinct. 230.

You will notice that the sight is bored or cherried out in the back, leaving only a very thin partition of steel on the face where the head is cut, and that there arc no sharp cor\\xc2\\xadners or flat surfaces to hunt across for the notch, but that the front sight just naturally slides down ~w~ A The origi11al buckhom sight (A, cross sectio1~ B. jro11t clevatio11) a11d the modem o11c (C) fo; comparisoll into place; also that the horns overhang th notch and shade it from nearly all angles-no blurring nor glimmering, always clear and sharp. We made a notched elevator just to balance the looks of it, but never used it; just drew fine or coar e, or for extreme ranges fine or coarse through tips of horns, which are slightly separated. Soon as you learn the range of your rifle you can do remarkably close shooting with it. That and the front sight I wrote you about made a darned good combination on any good rifle. W. L.

Burclbach This is the New Lyman Mi\\xc2\\xadcrometer Windgauge Combi\\xc2\\xb7 nation Rear Sight, and it is a good one too. The Lyman People knew what they were &lt;tl01ng when they got it up. No rifleman ran alford to be compelled to guess at adjustmg his sights in the middle of a string when he can as well have a sight which will tell him exactly JUSt how much adjustment he is making on the target. As the name implies, the leading feature of this sight is its mirrometer adjustment, both on windage and elevation. The pitch of the thread on both screws is 24 to the inch. Each complete revolution is graduated into ten parts which gives a change for each click of 1/z4o of an inch, which, with a 3o-inch sight .base, equals 1- 2 minute of angle or Yz inch at 100 yards, 7.:1: inch at 50 yards, and Ys inch at 25 yards, for each division indicated on the ~-traduated sleeves or for each &quot;click.&quot; This method of adjusting sights is far superior to the old Vernier system in that it elimmates all strain on the eye and also the hazy doubt that is always present when a Vernier or common sight is used. With this sight there is absolutely no guess work. With absolute surety one can change the adjustment of the sight in the middle of a string and know that each click will change the bullet Vs o ~ an inch both in windage and elevation. Lyman sends this sight out with cup disc, and duplicate cup discs may also be had with dif\\xc2\\xadferent apertures. There is in Dorchester, Mass., a Thomas Martin who can furnish for the above sight what he calls a o. 5 Multi-aperture cup, with different apertures to fit the cup, that is a I wonder. He also makes the discs to fit his cup with square apertures. A great deal might be said about the square aperture, but the main feature of tt is that the centering effect is the same as the round aperture and that it admits 25 per cent more light, making it a great eye saver. The above sight is made for most makes of riAes. THE QUALITY OF OUR WORK ADMITS OF NO EXCEPTIOSS SPORTSMAN\\'S SERVICE STATION Where Sporl3men Gather /rom Every Part of the World. TENAFLY, N. J.

RIFLE SHOOTING IN THE DARK. T llE target made at Camp Perr) by Colonel \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\xc2\\xb7n1&lt;1er by the l1ght of a small bonlire, published 1n the issue of August :l, prompts a fe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ remarks. Colonel \\\\\\\\Vindt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2r\\'s kat is poss1ble only w1th a t \\xc2\\xb7lescopic sight And the fact that it is poss1ble should cause our military authorities to take pract1cal notice. A lantern held by the enemy is sufficient hght for rifle lire with a telescopic sight. I ( you have a \\'scope on your nile, IL&gt;ok at a street lamp or lightetl window at any distance and obsene the cross-hairs in the \\'scope. On both Thanksgi\\\\\\\\ ing days for the yt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2ars last passed, the T\\\\\\\\:ansas City Rille Club has held a priz \\xc2\\xb7 shoot that we knew would la~t lun~ \\xe2\\x80\\xa2r than the daylight of the short \\'member days.. An ordinary hicyd lantern placed under and in front o( each target so its light shone on the target was more than ample light, as all those shooting used telescopes. t\\\\\\\\nd another thing noted hy all our shooters, the scores improved over daylight shooting. My theory of its ht\\'lng the lack of any distract\\xc2\\xading clement outside of the target, and, to the fact that in daylight the changing angle of the sun aiTects the light in the \\'scope and changes its line of sight-a good deal in some \\'scopes and very little in others To shoot accurately at night with s1ghts otlH\\xc2\\xb7r than telescopiC, would require very brilliant light at the target and some light at th \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 rille. A tele cope sight on the scrv1c \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 rifle has been in the past consid \\xe2\\x80\\xa2red au impracticable appliance, except \\xc2\\xa3or possibly, a small per cent of expert sharpshooters. 13ut a few dozen of top notch marksmen equip\\xc2\\xadped with such sights could undoubtedly make considerable trouble at night, if some method of insuring even a little light in the vicinity of the enemy could be devised. Jt would be easy enough to pro,\\xc2\\xb7idc light for defensive purposes. hut getting the enemy to even &quot;light his pipe,&quot; when the flare of a match might be his death warrant, would be a difficult matter. 282.

Manning, Ceres, Cal.- Vfhat is the v locity, trajectory and energy of the .25 Colt\\'s automatic pistol cartridge In the .25\\xc2\\xb7 35-callber rifles using the Marble Auxiliary cartridge, and the Colt\\'s .32 automatic pis\\xc2\\xadtol cartridge in the .303 Savage rifle using the auxiliary cartridge? Is the .35 Reming\\xc2\\xadton rimless cartridge more powerful than the .32 W. S. or .303 Savage? Answer by Ashley A. Haines.-! regret exceedingly my inability to obtain the bal\\xc2\\xadlistics for the cartridges mentioned when used with the Marble Auxiliary cartridges In rifles. Also that satisfactory ammuni\\xc2\\xadtion for testing out more than one caliber could not be obtained to furnish data for a reply to the above query. The one size tested, which gave results to be mentioned later, was for the .30\\xc2\\xb740 cart ridge used in a Winchester single-shot rifle of that caliber with Winchester soft-point, .32 Colt auto\\xc2\\xadmatic pistol cartridge. This rifle was equipped with open sights, such as I use for hunting, the distance shot being twenty\\xc2\\xadfive and fifty yards, all shooting being from rest. Fifty shots only were fired in the tests, though I used the auxiliary cartridges in this gun when bunting with satisfactory results on small game. One five-shot string at twenty-five yards gave a group in which all five shots can be completely cov\\xc2\\xadered by a 11,/,r,\\xc2\\xb7inch disc. One five-shot string at fifty yards, measuring from center of bul\\xc2\\xadlet holes farthest apart, measures as a group 2% inches. One ten-shot group at !lfty yards, measured in the same way, measures the same- 2% inches. Thirty shots, in ten-shot strings, at twenty-five yards, had they been made on the same tar\\xc2\\xadget, would all have been inside of a circle 1% inches in diameter. Twenty-eight of these shots on the same target would have been completely covered by a disc 1 \\'14 inches In diameter. The second ten-shot string, which was the smallest of the three, is shown herewith full size. Like nearly all light charges, when fired In high power ri\\xc2\\xadfles, the rltle did not shoot the above loads with sights as adjusted for the fu ll charges I had the ririe sighted for, and having but the one box (fifty) of cartridges :\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 t the time made no attempt to find the bull\\'s-eye; In other words, tested for group&gt;! only. I am pretty confident that had I held the same for all shots, the two wild ones which Second 10-shot string at 25 y&lt;ls, with Win chester .30-40 single shot rifle with Marble auxlllary chamber loaded with .. 32 Ct)\\\\\\\\t au\\xc2\\xadtomatic pistol cartridge of Winchester\\xc2\\xb7 mnkP. Open sights. Group exact size. enlarged the group to the size mentioned, would have been in the circle that would hold the twenty-eight shots had all thirty shots b en fired on the same target. At a later date I hope to have results others may have secured with these auxiliary cart\\xc2\\xb7 ridges. Also, If procurable, ballistics for same. I trl d out two other sizes, but with unsatisfactory results. Part of the ammuni\\xc2\\xadtion was very old, while the rest was of for\\xc2\\xadeign manufacture by a firm noted for let\\xc2\\xadting inferior cartridges find their way into the market. Many of the bull ~ts key\\xc2\\xb7 holed, while those that struck point , n often went wild. With good cartridges I , an sec no reason why other sizes should not per\\xc2\\xb7 form as well as the makers of the a iX!liary cartridges claim they will. Th .35 Remlng\\xc2\\xb7 ton cartridge is more powerful than the 32 Special or .303 Savage, as the following fig\\xc2\\xb7 ures will show : Energy for the .32 Special, 1,633 ft. lbs.; energy of the .303 Savage, with full metal-patched 182-grain bullet, 1,593 ft. lbs.; energy with the 195-grain, soft-point bullet, 1,658 ft. lbs.; energy of the .35 Remington, 1,776 ft. lbs.

The bear was about 125 yards from me, feed\\xc2\\xading with his head a\\\\\\\\vay from me. The bullet struck between the hind I quarters about three inches below the tail, passed into the body, and I found the jacket of the bullet imbedded in the backbone about 18 inches from where it entered the body of the bear. It crushed the backbone to powder for at least 8 inches. The bear went down in his tracks, rolled down the hill, lodging against a log, and was dead. &quot;:\\\\\\\\fter skinning out the bear we found that we could take a pointed stick and push it through the body in the region of where the back\\xc2\\xadbone had been. That part of the bear\\'s anatomy where the spinal \\'column had been was simply powdered to jelly. \\'&quot;The third .bear was also shot with , your rifle. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The bullet caught him at the base of the ear, grinding the back part of his skull and the neck as finely as they would have been ground had they passed through a sausage mill. That, of course, put the bear out of commission in a second. &quot;I am satisfied that your .256 is large enough for any of the game on this continent. This will certainly be the case when you are able to furnish the 140 grain bullet.&quot; 312. NEWTON RIFLES. OR,~ \\'l\\'f, Ill( ... z&quot; g 0 \\\\\\\\.1...). ..0. 312. ~1~.

To find the ordinate of thr trajectory at any dis\\xc2\\xadtance, that is to say the height ,of the bullet above the line of sight at any point in a range, subtract the angle of elevation for the distance at which the ordinate is required from the total angle for the range, and transform the remainder, which is in minutes, into inches, by multiplying by 1.0 17 for every 100 yards. Similarly, to obtain the drop of the bullet at any distance, multiply the angle of elevation for the distance by 1.017 for every 100 yards of the distance; and to obtain the time of flight, find the square root of the drop divided by 16.1. The ballistic co-eflicient of th bullet is .155, and with the foregoing data and formula every necessary ballistic calculation can be made. c; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 ~ ;_.. A: :r..

P. LA &quot;E THE member. of the thousands of IIome D fcnse Leagu s rapidly being organized all over the rountrr are equipping themselves principally with riAc and revolver. and most of them are already practicing at the target. I will try to ct down here a few points that fri nels of mine who arc instructors are emphasizing. Such, for instanre, as the right way to hold, the right way to . ight, amount of pressure to place on the grip, position of the arm , po ition of the feet, etc., and, most im\\xc2\\xadportant of all, the correct pull of the trigger. In riAe and revolver sho ting, the ability to pull the trigger at the right moment and with\\xc2\\xadout jarring the gun in any way is an art which must b mastered before the bullets will strike the bull\\'s-eyc with any d grcc of regularity. Even if you have eyes like an eagle and ran hold as stt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2ady as a rock, the bullets arc sure to go wild if you pull the trigger with a sudden yank rather than by a steadily increas\\xc2\\xading pressure. A beginner who is just starting in at the target with the riAe or revolv \\xe2\\x80\\xa2r is adv:secl to lin \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 up the sights as well as he can and hold as steadily as possible, but, for a whil at least, do not pay special attention to these points. Your whole energy should he oncen\\xc2\\xadtratcd on pulling the trigger propt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2rly. The sights may dance around on the target in a distressing mann r and perhaps th \\xc2\\xb7y will ap\\xc2\\xadpear fuzzy at times, but when you miss the target remcmb r that yanking th \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 trigger thr \\xc2\\xb7w your shot wild, for I have nev r seen a man yet who had such poor eyes or who was so shaky as to miss the target provided he could get that smooth and even I t-oll of the hammer that produce no visible jump in the gun. Some men learn how to shoot more quickly than others, ju t as some men learn how to swim or how to ride horseback more quickly than others who are not physically or tem\\xc2\\xadperamentally as well adapted. It is a rela\\xc2\\xadtively common impression that shooters are born and that if a man is not a born rifle or revolver shot, he will never become one. Such is not the case. Those of you who find the sights have edges like coarse fur and that the barrel wiggles around in a most distressing manner, should be cheered up considerably by the fact that it has been proven time and again that persistent practice will always pro\\xc2\\xadduce a considerable degree of skill. I have started in many shooters who seemed to be almost hopeless, but who in a comparatively short time produced surprisingly good scores. It will occur to many of you that practice in deliberate shooting at a large and clearly defined bull\\'s-eye on a target will never be of any practical use to you for the reason, as you will probably figure to yourself, that for home defense particularly the ability to shoot quickly and without preparation is of vital importance. In one way you are right. Slow\\xc2\\xadfire shooting is not directly useful, but it is the primary department of hooting and it teaches you the problems in a simplified form that you will be called upon to solve when you take up rapid shooting.

In other words this elevation will at 100 yards cause bullet to hit one inch higher on target: at 200 yards two incht\\xc2\\xb7s higher and so on. To illustrate: you fire a shot at the .t -inch regulati&lt; n hull\\'s-tye 100 yards and you tlnd hall strikt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2s two inches below center, how much must you raise rear sight to gt\\'t up to the center of the hull\\'s-eye? :\\\\\\\\nswt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2r is 2-100 of an inrh. for hy raising rear sight 2- tOO of an inch rnakt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2s the line of aim and line of flight from hullt-t to h &gt;re spread 2-100 of an inch for each and every yard from muzzle of rifle to hull\\'s-eye. &quot; ,\\\\\\\\t 200 )\\xc2\\xb7ards this same 2-100 of an inch elcva: ion will equal a four\\xc2\\xadinch raise of target. therefore all that is t1t\\'cessary for anyont\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 to do is to measure the distance between the sil-(hts nn your rille. then ascer,ain hy di,\\xc2\\xb7iding how many times this distann\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 will go into 100 yards or any numher of yards you desired to shnot.

In one in. tance -the sighting of the lady of the family and the le. ser one-third, there is a difference of from 12 to 15 inches in point of impact at the short range of 200 yards, when we usc the same rifle and think that we\\'re holding the same.

Sight in the rifle for the average hunter, make two bulls at 200, and he departs that place rejoicing, satisfied that he\\'ll register ac\\xc2\\xadcordingly on the first example of ali fornia fauna he runs across. Rarely do they want to shoot the rifle; if they do, and don\\'t hit where the skilled rifleman hits, they charge it to their poor holding, and refuse sight adjust\\xc2\\xadment to correct the case. The most exaggerated case of individual peculiarities in sighting came up within a week. A chap in the club, L. Z. Dezert, firing at 200 with his .22 repeater, a most accurate rifle, asked me to try a shot or two offhand. He was getting bulls and close fours. The marker reported via insulting wigwag that the first shot was a miss. On tearful plea to take another look he found the shot in the frame at 2 o\\'clock. A second shot registered a two just below it, a third one a three just on the two-line when the rifle was held a bit lower. Then I sat down, put on the sling, and sighted in the rifle to suit me. It was aver\\xc2\\xadaging 30 inches out at 2 o\\'clock. Sighting it into the bull and running out several bulls, I turned it over to its owner, who from the same position proceeded to make 7 o\\'clock and 8 o\\'clock threes, nearly into the two-ring. He alleged that he held a &quot;fine white line.&quot; I touched the bull. There might have been in the method of sighting a 4-inch difference\\xc2\\xadthe width of a &quot;fine white line.&quot; Instead there was a difference outside this of more than two feet at 200 yards I In spite of scores of such instances, familiar to every rifleman, ordnance departments the world over continue to turn out rifles without mean of zero adjustments-&quot;sighted in&quot; for that much-discussed but non-existent chap, the average man. Yet they strive for the military ideal of 4-inch groups at 200 yards, while they fail to care for differences in sighting that may put the whole sheaf of fire two feet out at the same range.

At the request of several of our r ader who are intere. ted in the subject of the possibilitie of rifle-work at extreme rang s we take the liberty of borrowing from &quot;Arms and the Man&quot; the following mo t interesting r port of actual &quot;antelope-shoot\\xc2\\xading&quot; tests at 1500 yards by Mr. Geor C. Shumaker: &quot;A story in the gun department of an\\xc2\\xadother magazine touches again upon that 1500-yard antelope-shooting experience re\\xc2\\xadlated to us by Mr. Crossman. &quot;This much cussed and discussed episode took place quite a few years ago when high\\xc2\\xadpower ammunition was \\'young and antelope numerous. However, I read of it and all its details back in 1907 or 190 , and having had considerable experience with long\\xc2\\xadrange shooting both in caribou hunts in Alaska and general hunting in New Mexico. Arizona and old Mexico, decided to find out to my own satisfaction what could be done with arms at this outrageous range. &quot;I had killed coyotes and mountain goats up to 600 yards, and once shot a caribou in Alaska at B27 yards (measured), using in all these shots a 6Y, mm. Mannlicher, so did not think the 1500 yards range out of all reason. However, here are my experi\\xc2\\xadments. &quot;I used an antelope figure, cut from stifE cardboard, colored and sized as ncar the original as possible. Next mcasur d o!I 1500 yards and s t up my figure. Returning to the firing point I discovered that it was impossible to sec the figure over the Lyman rear and ivory front sight of my New Springfield rifle. Snag No. 1 had been struck, and the ridicule of a majority of all the critics of the 1500 yards shooting seemed to he justified. &quot;l happily recalled that the first article said something about a telescope sight, so me for it. I fitted a Stevens B-power tele\\xc2\\xadscope to my New Springfield, and after -arefully targeting the rifle on a 36-inch bull\\'s-eye at 1500 yards, tried it on my ante\\xc2\\xadlope figure. The first shot was a bull-or antelope, rather-and out of 20 shots fired at this range, 11 hit the figure. I was satis\\xc2\\xadfied. The New Springfield would hit an antelope at 1500 yards, provided the range was known, the weather conditions good, and the ammunition hand-loaded. I used the 172-grain sharp-pointed bullet and 49 grains of 1908 powder. . . . &quot;For practical hunting this 1500 yards shooting was worthless, and only freak shots would connect; but at known dis\\xc2\\xadtances it was an altogether different story, and a man was certainly justified in risking a shot, if no other way could be found to get closer to the game.&quot; LONG RABGB SHOOTING. ------ 0 Long Shooting THE following answer to one of our correspondents is self-explanatory, and may be of interest to others a well: Dear Sir:-We are interested in your in\\xc2\\xadterest in the matter of &quot;Long Shooting.&quot; \\\\\\\\Vc arc as skeptical in the matter of long\\xc2\\xadrange work as the next man ; only we do not carry our skepticism to the point of disbelieving competent, reliable men :tnd expert shots when they report to us what has been done or what can be done. And the proof that that kind f men usually offer as to what can be done is to report what has been done. Also, when they re\\xc2\\xadport to us a remarkable and exceptional . performance, and call it such, we do not take it that they are telling us that they or any other man can do 1t all the time. IT cnce, we believe the so-called &quot;1,500-yard antelope story,&quot; for two reasons. First, we know Mr. Crossman and know him mighty well, and we don\\'t believe that he would tell a lie about it. (And if you knew him as well as we do you would say the sanie thing.)

All forms of sport have an effect on those \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ho play them and the effect on the player is often n dcterminin factor in the value of the sport. In many way:; shooting with a shot\\xc2\\xadgun, rifle or pistol either at a target or hunting in the lield is an especially \\\\\\\\\\'alttahle sport. It gives recreation and in addition develops to a high degree the mental faculty of concen\\xc2\\xadtration, and in fact a shooter\\'s suc\\xc2\\xadcess depends to a very large extent upon his ability to concentrate and co-ordinate the effort of every nerve and muscle 1to get the desired result. Slip- hod and careless people never become e~pcrts either os hunters or target shooters for they will not de\\xc2\\xadvote the necessary energy and thought to their problems. Consequently the man who makes a ucces of shooting is necessarily the one who can keep his mind working along the proper c-hannels. Boys and young men a.re often lacking alonrr th,\\xe2\\x80\\xa2s\\\\\" lines and that is o11e of thr reasons why shooting should he ,\\xc2\\xb7nconragccl especially in school and eo! leges. \\\\\\\\nother feature of shooting, and one which is rather important is th train\\xc2\\xading of the ~hooter\\' , t\\'ye. m. n wf10 ha. done a great deal of hooting, especially hunting, develop keen powers of obs rvation and u ually set\\'. things m re quickly and accurately than the average man who has never used his eye citht\\xe2\\x80\\xa2r to locate wary game or to make close visual adju t \\xc2\\xadments such as are nece. ary in prop\\xc2\\xadt\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 rly lining up the ights of a firearm .

They are born ~ho t5. Maybe it ih the gun used, im;tead of the man, but at any rate we have all met the fellow who kills game with uncanny regularity. nder ordinary circum\\xc2\\xad\\' tances, seeing is believing, but when it come5 to fishing and ~ hooting yarns, we long ago adopted the rule to believe nothing that we heard and only half that we 5aw. The illustration on this page shows you what we have 5een and we are going to tell you the tale as told to us. You can give the credit to either gun or gunner, as you see fit. On December 15, 1918, George S. Scofield, a lawyer with offices at Room 2289 Woolworth Building, New York City, and Capt. George Ackerly, a professional guide of Patchogue, Long Island, were shooting ducks from a double battery on Great South Bay. In this form of shooting the gunners lie side by side in the coffin-like compartment of the battery which is anchored off shore. As the duck5 come into the decoys which surround the battery, the gunners sit up and open t1re. A flock of broadbills decoyed. Both gunners rai,rd and fired one barrel. For the second shot Mr. Scofield was following a bird fairly well up in the air, while Captain Ackerly had picked out a bird closer to the water. Just a5 1\\\\\\\\[r. Scofield was about to pull the trigger, his bird crumpled and fell and he felt a jar as though his gun had been dis\\xc2\\xadrharged. However, he knew he had not shot and on opening his gun, he found the \\xc2\\xb7shell had not been fired. 1\\\\\\\\Ir. Scofield explains the incident in this way, and he has the gun to prove it. Just as he was about to fire, Captain Ackerly, swinging ahead of his bird, pulled the trigger. The charge from the Captain\\'s gun hit the barrels of Mr. Scofield\\'s gun about SL\\\\\"< inches from the muzzle, entered the left tube and followed on out the barrel, killing the duck that Mr. Scofield was aiming at. This barrel was almo5t entirely clo>ed and had Mr. Scofield pulled the trigger, the gun would undoubtedly have blown up and possibly killed both gunners. There you have ill Some men just naturally cannot help killing ducks, or maybe they train their !(Uns so no effort on their part is necessary. 13~ rl.~!J-~~\\\\\":\\\\\" ~ oli,\\'~ \\':J.~, 16fl \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 15.

Vertical Firing. 737J77,7,y. 20:ct. ~, w 1 JffZ\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 1 : _,,,, 62 Vertical Firing Editor Outdoor Life.-After reading Mr. Thomas\\' article on \\\\\"Star Hunting\\\\\" In the September issue it occurred to me that perhaps the results of some experiments on this line and the computations on altitude, time of flight, etc., might be of Interest. In the first place he has evidently been misinformed as to the range of the Spring\\xc2\\xadfield rifle, as he gives it as between seven and eight surface miles. Springfield, but can submit some on this work with the English service arm. The English Mark VII bullet weighs 174 grains and the velocity is 2,440 t. s., so there is after all not so very much difference in the ballistics of the two cartridges at long range. Mr. Tippins and other well-known Eng\\xc2\\xadlish rinemen have succeeded in timing the flight of vertically fired bullets. The Ordnance Department gives the ex\\xc2\\xadtreme range of the Springfield as 6,4Gfi yards, or a trifle over three miles. In this shooting the firing Is done at an angle or 45 degrees. The highest point of the tra\\xc2\\xadjectory is 6,844 feet and this height is reached at a distance of 3,432 yards !rom the firing point. The angle of descent Is about 68 degrees and the bullet strikes the ground with a remaining velocity computed at 203 ft. sees. Time of flight computed at 31 seconds. One or their interesting observations is that it strikes the ground with its point in the same direction as it leaves the gun. If fired straight up it comes down base first. The table or computations on vertical firing with English service ritle is as fol\\xc2\\xadlows : Height Velocity. Ascended. Time of Ascent. (Feet per second) (Feet) (Seconds) 2,440 0 2,400 59 2,000 680 1,500 1,569 1,000 3,238 500 7,139 0 9,816 0.00 0.02 0.31 0.84 2.22 7.68 19.66 Like many other readers of Outdoor Life, I began my shooting with sllng\\xc2\\xb7shot, cross\\xc2\\xadbow and bow and arrow. From what I could see of the flight of the projectiles I used I always supposed they carried far\\xc2\\xadther when fired at an angle than when shot straight up. So sure did I feel of this that I told a friend that in my opinion the Springfield would only shoot about two miles straight up. The bullet takes 31 seconds to reach the ground in its return and strikes the ground with a velocity of 473 feet per second. I have no data on vertical firing with the To settle a dispute could you please tell me whether a bullet fir d straight up from a Springfield rifle will reach the ground at the same velocity as It left the rifle? Will the bull t fall base or point first and what will be tho energy when It hits the ground? Also, how high will the bullet go?- I-I. N. Anderson, Portland, Ore. Answcr.-The bullet would strilte the ground with a small fraction of the velocity It possessed when It left the muzzle for the reasons given In the reply to Mr. Malone In this Issu e. If you have disturbed Its flight It would strike base first, but they occasion\\xc2\\xadally tip over and fall point first, In which case the velocity at strildng Is decidedly higher than In case where they come down base first. We have no data as to how high this particular bullet would go. The dis\\xc2\\xadcussion you have In mind will be found In the January, 1915, Issue of Outdoor Life, pages 88 to 90.-Edltor. () -1.4 .. , a-,., I \\'f 17. If a rifle were shot vertically and after the bullet came back to earth would the speed per second be the same as when It left the rifle, or less. If a round ball weighing a pound, and an ordinary buckshot, were dropped from an aeroplane a mile In the air, would they reach the earth at the same time? Both of these questions to be practical, tak\\xc2\\xadIng Into consideration air resistance, etc.; not as to textbooks on physlcs.-Carl Mahone, Cleveland, Ohio. Answer.-The bullet on striking the earth would have much less velocity than when It started upward for the reason that many times as much of thE!- energy of the bullet Is absorbed in overcoming air resistance as In overcoming the attraction of gravitation. The energy thus lost Is lost forever. On the return trip there Is likewise a great deal of energy absorbed by the resistance of the at\\xc2\\xadmosphere, and this, likewise, Is lost. The energy the bullet possesses when It strikes the earth Is that absorbed on the upward trip in overcoming the attraction of gravita\\xc2\\xadtion. Touching the dropping of the ball and the buckshot this would depend altogether on what the ball were made of. If it were lead the larger ball would reach the earth more quickly than the buckshot, as It would over\\xc2\\xadcome the air resistance better. If it were o! lighter material It would depend upon Its specific gravlty.-Edltor. California. E. L. STEJVENSON. Some weeks ago I replied In your valuable magazine to one \\\\\"Bill\\\\\" as to bow high a rifle will shoot. I also spoke of a question in mental \\xc2\\xb7arith\\xc2\\xadmetic as to how a, person could in\\xc2\\xadcrease his weight while standing on the scales by lifting up as much as possi\\xc2\\xadble, or by reaching up and pushing up with all his force on the beam of the scales. .I asked Mr. Chauncy Thomas why it was so that my weight would increase according to the amount of pressure exerted, to which Mr. Thomas replied: \\\\\"Nonsense,\\\\\" \\\\\"Impossible.\\\\\" That gentleman knows very little of Euclid, for it certainly increases your weight, according to the amount of pressure you exert over your own weight. Mr. T. has not tried it, hence he does not speak with the knowledge of \\\\\"proof.\\\\\"- E. M. Herron, Cleve\\xc2\\xadland, 0. Answer.-Mr. Thomas was certainly most disrespectful. A man would show \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 the same increase in weight under the circumstances mentioned as a spring would thru being placed in tension. Un\\xc2\\xadfortunately very few scales are suffi\\xc2\\xadciently sensitive to measure this.\\xc2\\xadEditor. 72.

Obviously ljeavy barr~?ls vibrate less than light, and heavy guns less than light. The vlbt\\'a\\xc2\\xb7 tlon originates In the barr 1 and Is transmitted thruout the gun.

Modern firearms are manufactured by machinery on a quantity basis and in the production of a new model the following steps must be gone through: \\\\\\\\~:uming that the inventor has finished a complete working model, thr first step towards putting th gun on the market is to make complete de\\xc2\\xadtailed drawings of every part of th gun. This takes considerable time as the dimensions of the various parts must be checked against each other, so that the allowable limits in the :>ize and shape of the parts will always produce a perfect working mechan\\xc2\\xadism. I Aft r the drawings of the parts arc completed, proce s engineers tak each individual part and decide on just how it is to be mad from the raw material to the fini h d part, and then also decid on th\\' kinds of ma\\xc2\\xadchines to be used. After that the plans go to tool d sign r who make drawings of the fixtures and jigs nec\\xc2\\xadessary to hold the work for ca h op\\xc2\\xaderation and th cutters which cut away the steel or wood to hapc the parts. These drawing arc sent to the tool room where the fixtures and other tools are made, and after that another gang of skilkd m chanics set up the machines and get them work\\xc2\\xading properly. These machines are then turned over to the machine hands who arc to operate them, and the manufacture of parts is begun. At every step of the work, expen\\xc2\\xadsive, specially made gauges must be used to see that the parts are exactly the right size and hape. The secret of the a. toni~hingly high quality and low CO>t of Ameril\\xc2\\xb7an made fire. rm lie in th pr tluction of many arm\\xc2\\xb7, all exactly ali \\xc2\\xb7e. \\'fher i a time interval of many. month. between the decision to man\\xc2\\xadufacture new firearm and the ap\\xc2\\xadpearance of the first model on the market and al o if production is once stoppc\\xe2\\x80\\xa2l on any model, even when everything- is ready to go ah ad, then~ will b-e everal months time between the forging of the rough tock to the final in pection of the finished arm, bee. u e each part must go through many operations in consecutive order. A part such as the receiver of a n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xc2\\xadpcating rifle or shotgun oft n requirl s as many as two or thr e hundred ~ eparatc distin t operations. mall parts such as pin and screws can of course be finished in quick time, but the complete gun must await the production of the part wh1ch requires longest to make. 192.

Rath; Can Be Forged Cold and Cost No More Than Iron Products. Perhaps the e~y long search nr lndu11try tor a metal which 111 lmper\\xc2\\xb7 vlous to rust and corrosion, which ce.., be twi11ted cold Into an auger or har.l\\xc2\\xb7 ened In the mukin~r 110 It m9,y be 11harpened like a razor, has ended wltn the discovery or an alloy by c. J. Rath. He cnlls It \\\\\"Everbrlte.\\\\\" Hath formerly Uved In \\'Varren, OhJo, where he 1pent many yean I working In an Iron foundry. Since boyhood, he ha. worked on the for\\xc2\\xb7 mula for a flux, or combination of chemical\\xe2\\x80\\xa2, which, 1\\'then burned with , certain metale will produce an alloy to etand up to all requirement!!. The alloy 111 made of lead, zinc, COli\\xc2\\xadper, nickel and man~raneee. The In\\xc2\\xadgredients are rlo eecret, he ald. The secret 11 the flux burned With them In a furnace which cau11e11 them to join together to make the new metal. This flux, Rath lllld, can be changed so the metal will be either bard or 11oft In any decree, It !11 tempered ln the alloying. A corporation, with $200,000 capital stock, ha.e been organized in Okh.\\xc2\\xadhoma City to mal(e this metal. A charter was applied for lut week. The temporary board ot directors Is composed of George G. Sohlberg, A. M. DeBolt, Charlel! Edward John\\xc2\\xadson, R. 0. Brewer, C. H. Russell. C. J. Rath and A. E. Kull. Rath, according to Kull, came to Oklahoma City with his proposition two months ago on request of the In\\xc2\\xb7 dustrlal development committee of the Chamber or Commerce, a committee or which Kull Js chairman. He had made one previous visit here and at that time told of his alloy to seveTal friends. He thim r-.turned to War\\xc2\\xadren, expecting to market his formula In the east, when bo was InVited to return. Under the direction of the com\\xc2\\xadmittee, samples of the alloy have been put under severe tests to dis\\xc2\\xadcover whether It would stand up to all claimed for lt. It hal! been submitted to the acid test and proved it wm not corrode, Kull said. Dr. Edwin D. Debarre, head or the departmellt of chemistry at the Unl\\xc2\\xadverstty f Oklahoma, hae made eev\\xc2\\xb7 eral ttllltll on It, according to Kull. He reporte4 It \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 restated the rust test and testa ma4e with all acids from tboM of the kltehen, 1uch all lemon Juice, to .\\xe2\\x80\\xa2troncer on\\xe2\\x80\\xa2. Doctor De- C. J. Rath. barre gave .It a tensile strength of 92,316 pound\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 to the square Inch, while the tensile strength of boiler eteel Is but about 66,000 pounda to the square Inch. It bas been tested In connection with fee and ammonia manufacturing mach!Mry and has been found to wltbetand tests which eteel or plate1 Iron would suffer under. Plain cast\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 lngs made from the alloy have been hammered and twisted without break\\xc2\\xadIng. When the same tests were worked upon common Iron castings, they broke into dozens of pieces, Kull said. Its principal value, according to Kull, Ill\\'s In the fact it can be made to practically replace nickel plated brass castings and will cost less to produce. It need not be plated and wlU last Indefinitely. Casting!! manufactured from \\\\\"Ever\\xc2\\xadbrlte\\\\\" have furthermore proved they will stand high speed machining, he said. The cost of manufacturing the metal ~\\xc2\\xb7111 be about the same a11 Iron products In many cases, In a11 much as less time will be required for ma\\xc2\\xadchining. PracUcnlly no time 111 re\\xc2\\xadquired for polishing after the lathe work as the alloy comes out fn a per\\xc2\\xadfectly emooth state, he declared. The company which will manufae\\xc2\\xb7 ture the alloy in Oklahorri& City wilt not spend any of Its money for pro\\xc2\\xadmotion purpose!!, Kull said. It wi!l make no campaign for the B8le of stock and Is payln!r nothlnc more tban etock fer the use of the formula.

An ordinary hicyd lantern placed under and in front o( each target so its light shone on the target was more than ample light, as all those shooting used telescopes. t\\\\\\\\nd another thing noted hy all our shooters, the scores improved over daylight shooting. My theory of its ht\\'lng the lack of any distract\\xc2\\xading clement outside of the target, and, to the fact that in daylight the changing angle of the sun aiTects the light in the \\'scope and changes its line of sight-a good deal in some \\'scopes and very little in others To shoot accurately at night with s1ghts otlH\\xc2\\xb7r than telescopiC, would require very brilliant light at the target and some light at th \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 rille. A tele cope sight on the scrv1c \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 rifle has been in the past consid \\xe2\\x80\\xa2red au impracticable appliance, except \\xc2\\xa3or possibly, a small per cent of expert sharpshooters. 13ut a few dozen of top notch marksmen equip\\xc2\\xadped with such sights could undoubtedly make considerable trouble at night, if some method of insuring even a little light in the vicinity of the enemy could be devised. Jt would be easy enough to pro,\\xc2\\xb7idc light for defensive purposes. hut getting the enemy to even \\\\\"light his pipe,\\\\\" when the flare of a match might be his death warrant, would be a difficult matter. 282.

Is the .35 Reming\\xc2\\xadton rimless cartridge more powerful than the .32 W. S. or .303 Savage? Answer by Ashley A. Haines.-! regret exceedingly my inability to obtain the bal\\xc2\\xadlistics for the cartridges mentioned when used with the Marble Auxiliary cartridges In rifles. Also that satisfactory ammuni\\xc2\\xadtion for testing out more than one caliber could not be obtained to furnish data for a reply to the above query. The one size tested, which gave results to be mentioned later, was for the .30\\xc2\\xb740 cart ridge used in a Winchester single-shot rifle of that caliber with Winchester soft-point, .32 Colt auto\\xc2\\xadmatic pistol cartridge. This rifle was equipped with open sights, such as I use for hunting, the distance shot being twenty\\xc2\\xadfive and fifty yards, all shooting being from rest. Fifty shots only were fired in the tests, though I used the auxiliary cartridges in this gun when bunting with satisfactory results on small game. One five-shot string at twenty-five yards gave a group in which all five shots can be completely cov\\xc2\\xadered by a 11,/,r,\\xc2\\xb7inch disc. One five-shot string at fifty yards, measuring from center of bul\\xc2\\xadlet holes farthest apart, measures as a group 2% inches. One ten-shot group at !lfty yards, measured in the same way, measures the same- 2% inches. Thirty shots, in ten-shot strings, at twenty-five yards, had they been made on the same tar\\xc2\\xadget, would all have been inside of a circle 1% inches in diameter. Twenty-eight of these shots on the same target would have been completely covered by a disc 1 \\'14 inches In diameter. The second ten-shot string, which was the smallest of the three, is shown herewith full size. Like nearly all light charges, when fired In high power ri\\xc2\\xadfles, the rltle did not shoot the above loads with sights as adjusted for the fu ll charges I had the ririe sighted for, and having but the one box (fifty) of cartridges :\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 t the time made no attempt to find the bull\\'s-eye; In other words, tested for group>! only.

The bear was about 125 yards from me, feed\\xc2\\xading with his head a\\\\\\\\vay from me. The bullet struck between the hind I quarters about three inches below the tail, passed into the body, and I found the jacket of the bullet imbedded in the backbone about 18 inches from where it entered the body of the bear. It crushed the backbone to powder for at least 8 inches. The bear went down in his tracks, rolled down the hill, lodging against a log, and was dead. \\\\\":\\\\\\\\fter skinning out the bear we found that we could take a pointed stick and push it through the body in the region of where the back\\xc2\\xadbone had been. That part of the bear\\'s anatomy where the spinal \\'column had been was simply powdered to jelly. \\'\\\\\"The third .bear was also shot with , your rifle. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The bullet caught him at the base of the ear, grinding the back part of his skull and the neck as finely as they would have been ground had they passed through a sausage mill. That, of course, put the bear out of commission in a second. \\\\\"I am satisfied that your .256 is large enough for any of the game on this continent. This will certainly be the case when you are able to furnish the 140 grain bullet.\\\\\" 312. NEWTON RIFLES. OR,~ \\'l\\'f, Ill( ... z\\\\\" g 0 \\\\\\\\.1...). ..0. 312. ~1~.

To find the ordinate of thr trajectory at any dis\\xc2\\xadtance, that is to say the height ,of the bullet above the line of sight at any point in a range, subtract the angle of elevation for the distance at which the ordinate is required from the total angle for the range, and transform the remainder, which is in minutes, into inches, by multiplying by 1.0 17 for every 100 yards. Similarly, to obtain the drop of the bullet at any distance, multiply the angle of elevation for the distance by 1.017 for every 100 yards of the distance; and to obtain the time of flight, find the square root of the drop divided by 16.1.

At the request of several of our r ader who are intere. ted in the subject of the possibilitie of rifle-work at extreme rang s we take the liberty of borrowing from \\\\\"Arms and the Man\\\\\" the following mo t interesting r port of actual \\\\\"antelope-shoot\\xc2\\xading\\\\\" tests at 1500 yards by Mr. Geor C. Shumaker: \\\\\"A story in the gun department of an\\xc2\\xadother magazine touches again upon that 1500-yard antelope-shooting experience re\\xc2\\xadlated to us by Mr. Crossman. \\\\\"This much cussed and discussed episode took place quite a few years ago when high\\xc2\\xadpower ammunition was \\'young and antelope numerous. However, I read of it and all its details back in 1907 or 190 , and having had considerable experience with long\\xc2\\xadrange shooting both in caribou hunts in Alaska and general hunting in New Mexico. Arizona and old Mexico, decided to find out to my own satisfaction what could be done with arms at this outrageous range. \\\\\"I had killed coyotes and mountain goats up to 600 yards, and once shot a caribou in Alaska at B27 yards (measured), using in all these shots a 6Y, mm. Mannlicher, so did not think the 1500 yards range out of all reason. However, here are my experi\\xc2\\xadments. \\\\\"I used an antelope figure, cut from stifE cardboard, colored and sized as ncar the original as possible. Next mcasur d o!I 1500 yards and s t up my figure. Returning to the firing point I discovered that it was impossible to sec the figure over the Lyman rear and ivory front sight of my New Springfield rifle. Snag No. 1 had been struck, and the ridicule of a majority of all the critics of the 1500 yards shooting seemed to he justified. \\\\\"l happily recalled that the first article said something about a telescope sight, so me for it. I fitted a Stevens B-power tele\\xc2\\xadscope to my New Springfield, and after -arefully targeting the rifle on a 36-inch bull\\'s-eye at 1500 yards, tried it on my ante\\xc2\\xadlope figure. The first shot was a bull-or antelope, rather-and out of 20 shots fired at this range, 11 hit the figure. I was satis\\xc2\\xadfied. The New Springfield would hit an antelope at 1500 yards, provided the range was known, the weather conditions good, and the ammunition hand-loaded. I used the 172-grain sharp-pointed bullet and 49 grains of 1908 powder. . . . \\\\\"For practical hunting this 1500 yards shooting was worthless, and only freak shots would connect; but at known dis\\xc2\\xadtances it was an altogether different story, and a man was certainly justified in risking a shot, if no other way could be found to get closer to the game.\\\\\" LONG RABGB SHOOTING. ------ 0 Long Shooting THE following answer to one of our correspondents is self-explanatory, and may be of interest to others a well: Dear Sir:-We are interested in your in\\xc2\\xadterest in the matter of \\\\\"Long Shooting.\\\\\" \\\\\\\\Vc arc as skeptical in the matter of long\\xc2\\xadrange work as the next man ; only we do not carry our skepticism to the point of disbelieving competent, reliable men :tnd expert shots when they report to us what has been done or what can be done. And the proof that that kind f men usually offer as to what can be done is to report what has been done. Also, when they re\\xc2\\xadport to us a remarkable and exceptional . performance, and call it such, we do not take it that they are telling us that they or any other man can do 1t all the time. IT cnce, we believe the so-called \\\\\"1,500-yard antelope story,\\\\\" for two reasons. First, we know Mr. Crossman and know him mighty well, and we don\\'t believe that he would tell a lie about it. (And if you knew him as well as we do you would say the sanie thing.) Secondly, the thinR has been duplicated by an expert who delih \\'rat ely tried it to see if it was pos\"],\"format\":[\"Manuscripts (documents)\",\"11\\\\\" x 8.5\\\\\"\",\"236 pages\",\"Pdf\"],\"identifier\":[\"HL_MSS80-24_68_J26\",\"http://wcudigitalcollection.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p16232coll8/id/1566\"],\"language\":[{\"name\":\"English\",\"iso639_3\":\"English\"}],\"publisher\":[\"Hunter Library Digital Collections, Western Carolina University, Cullowhee, NC 28723\"],\"relation\":[\"Western Carolina University Hunter Library\",\"MSS80-24\"],\"rights\":[\"All rights reserved.
